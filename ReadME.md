# Coursera Course Dataset Analysis

Project by Emilija B. originally created in **August 2022**. The project was uploaded later because it was previously stored in a different repository.

This Jupyter Notebook is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Coursera Courses dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about over 3,000 courses offered on the Coursera platform.

The analysis was written by baranema and is contained in the 135.ipynb file.

* matplotlib

These dependencies can be installed using pip or conda.

## Running the Notebook

To run this notebook, you can download the 135.ipynb file and open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Then, run each cell in the notebook sequentially to see the analysis and results.

## Analysis

The notebook starts by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset. It then proceeds to perform the following analyses:

* **Data cleaning and preprocessing**: This includes checking for missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and converting data types where necessary.
* **Data exploration**: This includes analyzing the distribution of courses by subject, level, and institution. It also explores the relationship between the course length and the number of course offerings.
***Data visualization**: This includes creating various plots and charts to visualize the data, including histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
* **Conclusions**: This includes summarizing the findings and drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a detailed analysis of the Coursera Courses dataset, exploring the various factors that contribute to the popularity and success of courses offered on the platform. The analysis and insights provided in this notebook can be used by educators and course developers to create better courses and improve the learning experience for students.
